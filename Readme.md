Tic-Tac-Toe

This application is for The Odin Project's "Tic-Tac-Toe" Project. 

My goal with this project is to demonstrate and develop understanding of modules and factor functions

-----------
Version 1.0
-----------

The game works functionally in all basic aspects!

Added animations to buttons for hover and activity.

-----------
Version 0.8
-----------

Updates:

- The game now resets properly and is nearly completely functional...

Bugs:

- the game allows the user to continue to attribute squares after a game ends.

-----------------
Version 0.7-0.7.3
-----------------

Updates:

- Acknowledges when the game is a draw.
- Acknowledges when the game has ended and stops taking input.
- Acknowledges when both O and X have won.
- Acknowledges when a game is won, but only for X.

Bugs:

- Game does not properly reset. Values for certain squares are stored even when cleared.

-----------
Version 0.6
-----------

Updates:

- Prevents selection of an occupied space.

-----------
Version 0.5
-----------

The interface + display now alternates between "X" and "O" with each click.

-----------
Version 0.4
-----------

A small update, linking the divs on the board to an array.

-----------
Version 0.3
-----------

The application now places an "X" on a square when clicked, and the reset button clicks. Additionally there is a display.

-----------
Version 0.2
-----------

The board is correctly produced and arranged as a graphic on the application.

-----------
Version 0.1
-----------

The script produces a grid on which to play. However, the corresponding array length is too long.
