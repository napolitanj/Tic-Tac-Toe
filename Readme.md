Tic-Tac-Toe

This application is for The Odin Project's "Tic-Tac-Toe" Project. 

My goal with this project is to demonstrate and develop understanding of modules and factor functions

Version 0.4
-----------

A small update, linking the divs on the board to an array.

-----------
Version 0.3
-----------

The application now places an "X" on a square when clicked, and the reset button clicks. Additionally there is a display.

Version 0.2
-----------

The board is correctly produced and arranged as a graphic on the application.

-----------
Version 0.1
-----------

The script produces a grid on which to play. However, the corresponding array length is too long.
